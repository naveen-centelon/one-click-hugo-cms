### Overview of Financial Inclusion

The Government initiated the National Mission for Financial Inclusion (NMFI), namely, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August, 2014 to provide universal banking services for every unbaked household, based on the guiding principles of banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded and serving unserved and underserved areas. A digital pipeline has been laid for the implementation of PMJDY through linking of Jan-Dhan account with mobile and Aadhaar \[Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM)].

In order to move towards creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the under-privileged, three ambitious Jan Suraksha Schemes or Social Security Schemes pertaining to Insurance and Pension Sector were announced by the Government in the Budget for 2015-16. The schemes were launched on 9th May, 2015, for providing life & accident risk insurance and social security at a very affordable cost namely (a) Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and (b) Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and (c) Atal Pension Yojana. Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana to protect elderly aged 60 years and above was initially opened for subscription for a period of one year i.e. from 4th May 2017 to 3rd May 2018.
